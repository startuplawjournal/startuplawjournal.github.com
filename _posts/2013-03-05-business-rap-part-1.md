I'm a pretty big fan of Ben Horowitz's [blog posts](http://bhorowitz.com/).  One thing that makes his writing unique is that he usually starts each post with a few rap bars that set the tone for the rest of the piece.  Given that I'm just starting to blog myself, I thought it might make sense to break down some of my favorite music from one of my favorite blogs.  

First, some quick observations:

<ul>
 
<li><strong>Broad range</strong>.  Horowitz samples pretty heavily from both different subgenres and eras of hip-hop.  The tracks range from more pop-heavy chart-topping Lil' Wayne to old school Geto Boys, with the heavy dose of classics like Nas and Ma$e.  It's clear that Horowitz has been a fan of hip-hop for some time, and that he stays current.</li>  

<li><strong>Not just hip-hop</strong>.  While the vast majority of the lines are hip-hop related, there are a few that aren't.  The ones that stuck out to me where The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again," Prince's "The Future," and a trio of funk tracks by Parliament, Funkadelic, and Whodini.</li>  

<li><strong>The message matters</strong>.  This is a topic that should expand in to its own blog post, but there's something unique about rap that really seems to lend itself towards business.  Some Horowitz blog posts tie the lyrics in to the content more than others, but there's always a core connection between the two.</li>

</ul>

And now, my three of favorite choices so far:

<ul>
 
<li><strong>Nas = U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography Of Rakim)</strong>.  There's no better "story rapper" out there than Nas.  All of my favorite Nas tracks are full narratives and this track from Street's Disciple puts a new spin on the typical approach by going through some of Rakim's biography.  It's not my favorite beat in the world, but the classic Nas narrative on Rakim's story puts this among my favorites.  </li>  

<li><strong>Outkast - Church</strong>.  Listen to this song in your car on a sunny Sunday morning and try not to crack a smile or bob your head.  This is classic Outkast from one of their classic albums.  A great beat under some great Andre 3000 and Big Boi bars put this on my list.</li>  

<li><strong>Kanye West - Good Morning</strong>.  This track gets a place on the list because it's the title track on one of my all time favorite albums.  Graduation is still an album that you can just throw on and feel good listening to the whole thing straight through.</li>

</ul>

In my next post, I'll break down some tracks and lyrics that I think would be great candidates for making Horowitz's blog in the future.  I'll also talk about about why I think there's a natural connection between rap and business.  In the meantime, here is a spotify playlist of all the songs on spotify that show up on Horowitz's blog.  I've made it collaborative so feel free to add any tracks if you find them missing.
