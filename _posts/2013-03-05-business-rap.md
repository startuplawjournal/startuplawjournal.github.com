I'm a pretty big fan of Ben Horowitz's [blog posts](http://bhorowitz.com/).  One thing that makes his writing unique is that he usually starts each post with a few rap bars that set the tone for the rest of the piece.  

Some quick observations:

<ul>
 
<li><strong>Broad range</strong>.  Horowitz samples pretty heavily from both different subgenres and eras of hip-hop.  The tracks range from more pop-heavy chart-topping Lil' Wayne to old school Geto Boys, with the heavy dose of classics like Nas and Ma$e.  It's clear that Horowitz has been a fan of hip-hop for some time, and that he stays current.</li>  
<br>
<li><strong>Not just hip-hop</strong>.  While the vast majority of the lines are hip-hop related, there are a few that aren't.  The ones that stuck out to me where The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again," Prince's "The Future," and a trio of funk tracks by Parliament, Funkadelic, and Whodini.</li>  
<br>
<li><strong>The message matters</strong>.  This is a topic that should expand in to its own blog post, but there's something unique about rap that really seems to lend itself towards business.  Some Horowitz blog posts tie the lyrics in to the content more than others, but there's always a core connection between the two.</li>
<br>
</ul>

I've made Spotify playlist of all the available songs that show up on Horowitz's blog.  It's collaborative so feel free to add any tracks if you find them missing.
